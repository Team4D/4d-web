				    	Team 4th Dimension are a group of programming enthusiasts who met in a class at KU. 
				Though originally they began working together for a class project, they found that 
				they worked well with one another and got along well. The majority of the team went 
				on to work on the next class project which evolved past simply an assignment and and 
				is currently being developed into the Android application "LoL Helper".

                 Designed from the Top Down
          Our process begins with a deep brainstorming session. We meet with each person involved in the 
          process - from your team to ours - to have thier individual input included. This master list is then pared 
          down, separating the chaff from the wheat, then expanded upon to create the abstract overview of tasks to 
          complete the project

            Dynamic Convergence
        Keeping our sub teams informed at weekly meetings is a way for us to reconnect as a group to make certain that the product
        is made right the first time. Conferences with our clients connect them in the process, allowing you the chance to voice any and 
        all concerns with our knowledgeable staff. A staff who knows how to speak both computer jargon and plain language fluently.

             Built from the Ground Up
        After that introductory meeting, we break into teams to attack the generated task list head on. Each sub team is 
        tasked with a single slice of the overarching task outline. By taking each part of the whole and treating it as a 
        module we not only create a more functional end product, we complete it so fast you'll wonder why you didn't visit us sooner.
